The power of freedom
November 25

I attended a lecture in the law faculty in Prague where Marek Orko Vácha (Czech Theologist) defined the human capacity by the main 3 pillars: genetics, environment, and lastly freedom - our ability to get better (the most important one). I happened to get injured while doing my college sport (very nifty me). While it sucks, I was often times thinking about things I normally wouldn’t have to think about, simply because I didn’t have too much free time. One of them is the power of freedom (which is kinda a double-edged sword). It is one of the basic rights everyone should have, but with that - responsibility comes in. Before my injury, my schedule was so packed that I never had time to think about what I should do with my own free time, it simply didn't exist.

Now here comes the paradox - freedom itself can feel like a loss of freedom for somebody. When all the external forces go away, the openness can sometimes become overwhelming. So the question becomes: how do I use my freedom without becoming trapped by the possibilities it gives me?

Well, that’s something everyone should think about. From my own experience, the most important thing is to find balance. What I mean by that?

Balance is the point where freedom stops being a burden and starts becoming a tool. Too much structure, and you feel trapped. Too much openness, and you feel lost. 
When I find myself in the middle, I feel that I have the right direction and discipline to move forward but enough freedom to choose where I move and what makes sense for me - so I can actually enjoy what I’m doing and make real progress. This balance makes sure that the freedom pillar is truly the most important one.
