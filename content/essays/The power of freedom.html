      <h1 class="title">The power of freedom</h1>
      <h3 class="date">November 25</h3>
      <p class="essay">
        I attended a lecture in the law faculty in Prague where Marek Orko Vácha
        (Czech Theologist) defined the human capacity by the main 3 pillars:
        genetics, environment, and lastly freedom - our ability to get better
        (the most important one). I happened to get injured while doing my
        college sport (very nifty me). While it sucks, I was often times
        thinking about things I normally wouldn’t have to think about, simply
        because I didn’t have too much free time. One of them is the power of
        freedom (which is kinda a double-edged sword). It is one of the basic
        rights everyone should have, but with that - responsibility comes in.
        Before my injury, my schedule was so packed that I never had time to
        think about what I should do with my own free time, it simply didn't
        exist.

        Now here comes the paradox - freedom itself can feel like a loss of
        freedom for somebody. When all the external forces go away, the openness
        can sometimes become overwhelming. So the question becomes: how do I use
        my freedom without becoming trapped by the possibilities it gives me?
      </p>
      <p class="essay">
        Well, that’s something everyone should think about. From my own
        experience, the most important thing is to find balance. What I mean by
        that?
      </p>
      <p class="essay">
        Balance is the point where freedom stops being a burden and starts
        becoming a tool. Too much structure, and you feel trapped. Too much
        openness, and you feel lost. When I find myself in the middle, I feel
        that I have the right direction and discipline to move forward but
        enough freedom to choose where I move and what makes sense for me - so I
        can actually enjoy what I’m doing and make real progress. This balance
        makes sure that the freedom pillar is truly the most important one.
